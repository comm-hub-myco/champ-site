Matte black, like Finnish licorice, with cup-like depressions. I mistakenly thought the name had something to do with the former Soviet country, Bulgaria, but etymology filled the binomial with color and motion: ?inflated,? ?blister-like;? ?dirtying,? ?polluting,? ?blackening,? ?staining,? ?making unclean.? So be it - the dirty, bulging fungi left me feeling renewed. Larry?s words and our presence as a group in the woods ? Jula, his Dad, Martin, and son Micha; Dan, Liam, Sean, KieuLy, Larry, and myself ? amplified a simple message: even on a chilly, steel-grey New England morning, the forest floor holds a cache of little treasures ? like Hanukkah gelt or Christmas cookies ? cups, crusts, and jellies, resplendent in a quiet but full-throated way, edging out the inelegant rumble of the MBTA commuter rail trundling by. Arboreal chamber music enjoyed from front-row seats, reminding me of John Cage, amateur mycologist and vanguard creator of aleatory music: ?There is no such thing as an empty space or an empty time. There is always something to see, something to hear. In fact, try as we may to make a silence, we cannot.? A quick rundown of notable species seen: a cascade of lumpy polypores ? Trametes gibbosa; oak-log sections tinted with green wood-staining fungus ? Chlorociboria sp.; tiny matchstick fungi ? Phaeocalicium polyporaeum ? lifting off from the margins of purple-tooth polypores ? Trichaptum abietinum; and, as if bidding us farewell like tiny munchkins from Oz, a ?hairy fairy? ? Lachnum virgineum; and a troupe of Mycena sp. *On the Horizon* Stay tuned for our next events. Plans are underfoot for a movie night pegged to an ethnographic film.
