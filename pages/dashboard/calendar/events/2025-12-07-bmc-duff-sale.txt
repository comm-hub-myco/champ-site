Description: Boston Mycology Club is hosting it's final social event of the year! The concept of a duff sale is to bring mushroom items that you no longer need and donate them to the sale table. It's a great chance to have a bite to eat and talk about mushrooms. There will be refreshments and wine as well as a potluck (bring a dish!). Proceeds benefit the BMC and help to bring more programs and events for 2026!
