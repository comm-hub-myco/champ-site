  "description": "This video shows a mushroom that I had found in Wareham. The cap appears multicolored. The stem has a reticulation-like pattern. The substrate where I found the mushroom is mostly sandy soil covered with a grassy/moss layer. The reticulation-like pattern on the stem turned completely ink-black after a number of days. It gave the impression that it was glossy-wet, but it was actually dry. I am putting it out there for anyone to feel free to attempt to identify it. I have posted it on iNaturalist without any results. I have also shared the video with BMC members without any clue of what it is. It’s such a striking and beautiful mushroom that I am committed to pursue until it is identified.",
